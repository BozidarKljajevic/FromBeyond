The background story of how the game world came into being and what problems exist in the game is given below:
Let me tell you a story of how it all began. For centuries, mankind has been seeking a way to extend their lifespans..dreaming of one day achieving immortality. Many years ago, led by an idea of eternal life, 4 great scholars of those times, one of them - a painter, gathered in dark, secluded chambers in order to devise a plan to capture DEATH itself. They conducted a series of deadly experiments hoping to lure Death. It fell into the trap they had prepared. The scholars took aways its skull which rendered death powerless, unable to escape their trap. The painter realized the mistake they were making but none of his companions would listen. Thus, death remained trapped and since that moment people lived eternaly. The natural cycle of life and death had been broken, leaving humanity with a variety  of  otherwise fatal diseases which are now, without death, worse than they had ever been.
